    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        An octopus (pl. octopuses/octopi, see below for variants) is a soft-bodied, eight-limbed mollusc of the order
        <a href="Octopoda"> Cephalopoda</a> (/ɒkˈtɒpədə/, ok-TOP-ə-də[3]). The order consists of some 300 species and is
        grouped within the class
        with squids, cuttlefish, and nautiloids. Like other cephalopods, an octopus is bilaterally symmetric
        with two eyes and a beaked mouth at the center point of the eight limbs.[a] The soft body can radically alter
        its shape, enabling octopuses to squeeze through small gaps. They trail their eight appendages behind them as
        they swim. The siphon is used both for respiration and for locomotion, by expelling a jet of water. Octopuses
        have a complex nervous system and excellent sight, and are among the most intelligent and behaviourally diverse
        of all invertebrates.
    </p>
    <p>
        Octopuses inhabit various regions of the ocean, including coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the seabed; some live
        in the intertidal zone and others at abyssal depths. Most species grow quickly, mature early, and are
        short-lived. In most species, the male uses a specially adapted arm to deliver a bundle of sperm directly into
        the female's mantle cavity, after which he becomes senescent and dies, while the female deposits fertilised eggs
        in a den and cares for them until they hatch, after which she also dies. Strategies to defend themselves against
        predators include the expulsion of ink, the use of camouflage and threat displays, the ability to jet quickly
        through the water and hide, and even deceit. All octopuses are venomous, but only the blue-ringed octopuses are
        known to be deadly to humans.

        states that the only acceptable plural in English is "octopuses", that "octopi" is misconceived, and "octopodes"
        pedantic;[13][14][15] the last is nonetheless used frequently enough to be acknowledged by the descriptivist
        Merriam-Webster 11th Collegiate Dictionary and Webster's New World College Dictionary. The Oxford English
        Dictionary lists "octopuses", "octopi", and "octopodes", in that order, reflecting frequency of use, calling
        "octopodes" rare and noting that "octopi" is based on a misunderstanding.[16] The New Oxford American Dictionary
        (3rd Edition, 2010) lists "octopuses" as the only acceptable pluralisation, and indicates that "octopodes" is
        still occasionally used, but that "octopi" is incorrect.[17]

    <h2>Etymology and pluralisation</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The scientific Latin term octopus was derived from Ancient Greek ὀκτώπους, a compound form of ὀκτώ (oktō,
        "eight") and πούς (pous, "foot"), itself a variant form of ὀκτάπους, a word used for example by Alexander of
        Tralles (c. 525–c. 605) for the common octopus.[5][6][7] The standard pluralised form of "octopus" in English is
        "octopuses";[8] the Ancient Greek plural ὀκτώποδες, "octopodes" (/ɒkˈtɒpədiːz/), has also been used
        historically.[9] The alternative plural "octopi" is considered grammatically incorrect because it wrongly
        assumes that octopus is a Latin second declension "-us" noun or adjective when, in either Greek or Latin, it is
        a third declension noun.[10][11]

        Historically, the first plural to commonly appear in English language sources, in the early 19th century, is the
        latinate form "octopi"; followed by the English form "octopuses" in the later half of the same century. The
        hellenic plural is roughly contemporary in usage, although it is also the rarest.[12]

    <h2>Respiration</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        espiration involves drawing water into the mantle cavity through an aperture, passing it through the gills, and
        expelling it through the siphon. The ingress of water is achieved by contraction of radial muscles in the mantle
        wall, and flapper valves shut when strong circular muscles force the water out through the siphon.[41] Extensive
        connective tissue lattices support the respiratory muscles and allow them to expand the respiratory chamber.[42]
        The lamella structure of the gills allows for a high oxygen uptake, up to 65% in water at 20 °C (68 °F).[43]
        Water flow over the gills correlates with locomotion, and an octopus can propel its body when it expels water
        out of its siphon.[42][40]

    <h3>Digestion and excretion</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The digestive system of the octopus begins with the buccal mass which consists of the mouth with its chitinous
        beak, the pharynx, radula and salivary glands.[45] The radula is a spiked, muscular tongue-like organ with
        multiple rows of tiny teeth.[29] Food is broken down and is forced into the oesophagus by two lateral extensions
        of the esophageal side walls in addition to the radula. From there it is transferred to the gastrointestinal
        tract, which is mostly suspended from the roof of the mantle cavity by numerous membranes. The tract consists of
        a crop, where the food is stored; a stomach, where food is ground down; a caecum where the now sludgy food is
        sorted into fluids and particles and which plays an important role in absorption; the digestive gland, where
        liver cells break down and absorb the fluid and become "brown bodies"; and the intestine, where the accumulated
        waste is turned into faecal ropes by secretions and blown out of the funnel via the rectum.[45]
