        An octopus (pl. octopuses/octopi, see below for variants) is a soft-bodied, eight-limbed mollusc of the order
        <a href="Octopoda"> Cephalopoda</a> (/ɒkˈtɒpədə/, ok-TOP-ə-də[3]). The order consists of some 300 species and is
        grouped within the class
        with squids, cuttlefish, and nautiloids. Like other cephalopods, an octopus is bilaterally symmetric
        with two eyes and a beaked mouth at the center point of the eight limbs.[a] The soft body can radically alter
        its shape, enabling octopuses to squeeze through small gaps. They trail their eight appendages behind them as
        they swim. The siphon is used both for respiration and for locomotion, by expelling a jet of water. Octopuses
        have a complex nervous system and excellent sight, and are among the most intelligent and behaviourally diverse
        of all invertebrates.

        Octopuses inhabit various regions of the ocean, including coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the seabed; some live
        in the intertidal zone and others at abyssal depths. Most species grow quickly, mature early, and are
        short-lived. In most species, the male uses a specially adapted arm to deliver a bundle of sperm directly into
        the female's mantle cavity, after which he becomes senescent and dies, while the female deposits fertilised eggs
        in a den and cares for them until they hatch, after which she also dies. Strategies to defend themselves against
        predators include the expulsion of ink, the use of camouflage and threat displays, the ability to jet quickly
        through the water and hide, and even deceit. All octopuses are venomous, but only the blue-ringed octopuses are
        known to be deadly to humans.

        states that the only acceptable plural in English is "octopuses", that "octopi" is misconceived, and "octopodes"
        pedantic;[13][14][15] the last is nonetheless used frequently enough to be acknowledged by the descriptivist
        Merriam-Webster 11th Collegiate Dictionary and Webster's New World College Dictionary. The Oxford English
        Dictionary lists "octopuses", "octopi", and "octopodes", in that order, reflecting frequency of use, calling
        "octopodes" rare and noting that "octopi" is based on a misunderstanding.[16] The New Oxford American Dictionary
        (3rd Edition, 2010) lists "octopuses" as the only acceptable pluralisation, and indicates that "octopodes" is
        still occasionally used, but that "octopi" is incorrect.[17]
